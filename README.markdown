## DESCRIPTION:

Micronaut is a light-weight BDD test framework.

## FEATURES:

* API compatible with RSpec (of course)

* Slim and light, designed to be readable, compact, and fast.  Just over ~1600 LOC in /lib at last count.

* Each example has its own metadata, and you can add filters or modules to run/disable/enhance examples based on that metadata at run time
* A Real-world example of the power the metadata gives you:

* "Focused examples".  Never drop out of Autotest again - just focus on the example(s) and ignore the rest:

		Micronaut.configure do |c| # in your example_helper
		  c.filter_run :focused => true
		end	

		describe Foo do
			it "this example will run", :focused => true do
			end
			
			# equivalent to:
			focused "so will this one (this is an alias for :focused => true)" do
			end
			
			it "this example will not run, until the focused ones are removed" do
			end
		end
		
* Add your own metadata options and customize Micronaut to your hearts content (pending specs are implemented as ':pending => true' metadata, for example)
		
* Designed to be formatter compatible with RSpec (though this needs some real-world testing)

* Rake task for simple setup

		 require 'rubygems'
		 require 'micronaut/rake_task'

		 desc "Run all micronaut examples"
		 Micronaut::RakeTask.new :examples do |t|
		   t.pattern = "examples/**/*_example.rb"
		 end

		 desc "Run all micronaut examples using rcov"
		 Micronaut::RakeTask.new :coverage do |t|
		   t.pattern = "examples/**/*_example.rb"
		   t.rcov = true
		   t.rcov_opts = "--exclude \"examples/*,gems/*,db/*,/Library/Ruby/*,config/*\" --text-summary  --sort coverage --no-validator-links" 
		 end
